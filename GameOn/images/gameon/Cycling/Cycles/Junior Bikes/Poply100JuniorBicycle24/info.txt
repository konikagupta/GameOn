Soft, sport saddle. 2 fingered braking system with powerful V- brakes. Attractive colours on the frame, saddle, Grips, and pedals. Aluminium rust proof wheels and brake leavers.

Frame: Steel frame. The advantage of the steel frame is the durability and rigidity it brings to your cycle. It has the ability to absorb shocks and vibrations constantly for years and still maintain its rigidity without collapsing.

Brakes: Helical spring V-brakes. Wide brake pads provide powerful and progressive braking system. The pads work on wet and dry conditions. 2 figure aluminium lever reduces stress on the hands. The brake levers are also lowered down in angle to have the correct hand position while applying the brakes.
